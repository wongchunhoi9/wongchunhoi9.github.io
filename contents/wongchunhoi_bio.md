### **Biography**

畢業於城市大學創意媒體學院，主修批判性跨媒體實驗室。作品主要涉及聲音和電子零件。視坦白為創作原則，以悲憤作為創作源動力。總是希望透過創作思考如何展現科技媒界獨有的無用之用及其敘事方式。2018年獲第二十三屆ifva獨立短片及影像媒體比賽「媒體藝術」組金獎。
現為句點藝術群體成員之一，打理藝術空間[「據點・句點」](http://floatingprojectscollective.net/)的大小事務。平日於本地媒體創作公司「十下創作」打工，副業為處理一切與聲音相關的工作。


Graduated from the School of Creative Media in City University of Hong Kong, majored in Critical Intermedia Laboratory. He treats Anger as the initiation of making art. His works mainly involve sound and electronics. Being honest and sincere is his basic creative principle. His work aimed at exploring the necessary useless-ness of technological medium, and to regain the consciousness of articulation of them. Wong got the gold award (Media Art category) in the 23rd ifva festival.
Currently working as the artistic engineer in self-run art space ["Floating Projects"](http://floatingprojectscollective.net). Sometimes he works as sound designer and engineer.
